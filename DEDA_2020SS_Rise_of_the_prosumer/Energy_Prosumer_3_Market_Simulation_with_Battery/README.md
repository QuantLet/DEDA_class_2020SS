Name of Quantlet: 'Energy_Prosumer_3_Market_Simulation_with_Battery'

Published in: 'DEDA_class_2020SS'

Description: 'Market simulation with a battery in a microgrid, battery charging and discharging rates in a microgrid with a battery and the supply demand ratio are calculated. Energy prices are then determined using the current tariffs in Germany and energy bills are calculated using a P2P pricing mechanism. The economic profitability of the microgrid is evaluated via self-consumption rates, self-sufficiency of the grid and a comparison of costs for the participants with and without P2P trading.'

Keywords: 'energy consumption, energy production, net load, battery simulation, line graph, boxplot, pricing mechanism, economic evaluation'

Datafile: 

Input: 'csv-files containing energy production data in 15-minute time interval, self-consumption of prosumers, net production of prosumers, consumption of consumers,  aggregate production and consumption, net load and battery simulation'

Output: 'csv-files containing the interaction with the grid, the demand covered by the community grid, the battery charging power, the battery discharging power,
