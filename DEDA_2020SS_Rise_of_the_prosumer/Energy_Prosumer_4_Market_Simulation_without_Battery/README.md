Name of Quantlet: 'Energy_Prosumer_4_Market_Simulation_without_Battery'

Published in: 'DEDA_class_2020SS'

Description: 'Market simulation without battery in microgrid, the procedure is the same as in script 3 except for not including a battery in the microgrid. Again the supply demand ratio is calculated.  Energy prices are then determined using the current tariffs in Germany and energy bills are calculated using a P2P pricing mechanism. The economic profitability of the microgrid is evaluated via self-consumption rates,  self-sufficiency of the grid and the cost of community energy as well as individual energy bills.'

Keywords: 'energy consumption, energy production, net load, line graph, pricing mechanism, economic evaluation'

Datafile: 

Input: 'csv-files containing energy production data in 15-minute time interval, self-consumption of prosumers, net production of prosumers, consumption of consumers,  agregate production and consumption, net load and battery simulation'

Output: 'csv-files containing energy demand covered by production of the microgrid, the supply demand ratio with no battery, the energy selling and buying prices, the self-consumption rate of the grid, the self-sufficiency of the grid, the cost of the community energy,
