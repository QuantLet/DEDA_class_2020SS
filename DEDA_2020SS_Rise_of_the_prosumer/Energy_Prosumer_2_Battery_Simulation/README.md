Name of Quantlet: 'Energy_Prosumer_2_Battery_Simulation'

Published in: 'DEDA_class_2020SS'

Description: 'Battery simulation: the net energy load is calculated by subtracting aggregate consumption from aggregate production by prosumers. Then, a simulation of six different battery sizes is done.'

Keywords: 'energy consumption, energy production, net load, battery simulation, line graph'

Author: 'Anna-Lena Hock and Sabrina Daun'

Datafile: 

Input: '100 consumer/prosumer data sets containing energy consumption/production in 3-minute intervals for one year (2017) from  https://github.com/QuantLet/BLEM/tree/master/data'

Output: 'csv-files containing energy production data in 15-minute time interval, self-consumption of prosumers, net production of prosumers, consumption of consumers,  aggregate production and consumption, net load and battery simulation; plotted battery simulation'
